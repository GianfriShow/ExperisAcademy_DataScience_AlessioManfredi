# comments are extremely light on the code, basically negligible
# they have no effect on the program execution whatsoever, they're ignored
# they are extremely important since they help ourselves or others understand exactly what's happening in the code
# as a trick, we can use comments to temporarily disable certain pieces of code for testing/debugging
# when we use "#", the comment starts in one line and ends there automatically
# we can use the shortcut Toggle Line Comment (Ctrl+/ for me) to (de)comment an entire selection of code
''' we can use triple single quotes (') or double quotes (") to start a comment and end it whenever we want, extending it over multiple lines'''
